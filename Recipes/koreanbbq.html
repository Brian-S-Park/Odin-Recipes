                <li>soybean paste</li>
                <li>hot pepper paste</li>
                <li>green onions</li>
                <li>lettuce</li>
                <li>perilla leaves</li>
                <li>green chili pepper</li>
                <li>cucumber</li>
                <li>carrot</li>
            </ul>
            <h2>Directions</h2>
            <ol>
                <li>Trim excess fat from the short ribs and rinse a couple times in cold water.</li>
                <li>Soak the ribs in cold water for 10-20 minutes to remove the blood.</li>
            </ol>
            <h3>Make the Marinade:</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>In a large bowl, add ⅓ cup soy sauce, ⅓ cup water or cooking wine, ¼ cup honey (or ⅓ cup brown sugar), and 1 ts ground black pepper.</li>
                <li>Blend 1 Korean pear (about 2 cups’ worth), 8 cloves of garlic, 1 medium onion, and 1 ts of chopped ginger until it turns into a white creamy liquid.</li>
                <li>Add it to your soy sauce base and add 2 tbs toasted sesame oil.</li>
                <p3>*tip: If you can’t find a Korean pear, use 2 ripe bosc pears. I sometimes use bosc pears and they work well.</p3>
                <li>Rinse the short ribs in fresh cold water a couple more times to remove any remaining bone fragments. Drain the water.</li>
                <li>Add the ribs to the marinade and mix it well, by hand.</li>
                <li>Keep it in the refrigerator for at least an hour. Overnight is better, but an hour is ok if you are short of time.</li>
            </ol>
            <h3>Make ssamjang dipping sauce:</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>Mix these 2 tbs soy bean paste, 1 tbs of hot pepper paste, 1 stalk of chopped green onion, 1 clove of minced garlic, 1 ts honey, 1 ts of toasted sesame oil, and 1 ts sesame seeds in a small bowl with a spoon.</li>
            </ol>
            <h3>Preapre vegetables:</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>Rinse and drain lettuce and perilla leaves. Put them on a plate or basket.</li>
                <li>Cut a cucumber into strips 3½ inch to 4 inches in length and ½ inch thick (8-10 cm long x1½ cm thick),</li>
                <li>Chop green chili peppers and slice a few cloves of raw garlic and put them next to green lettuce and perilla leaves.</li>
            </ol>
            <h3>Let's cook and eat!</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>Grill, pan fry, or BBQ the ribs. The LA style cut is thin, so they’re cooked much faster than usual ribs. It takes only about 5 minutes!</li>                
                <li>When the both sides are cooked, put them on a serving plate.  Cut the meat part off the bone with scissors into bite sized pieces.</li>
                <li>Put a piece of meat on top of a lettuce leaf and a periilla leaf. Add dipping sauce, garlic, and a piece of green chili pepper. Fold it over into a small package, and pop it into your mouth in one bite!</li>
            </ol>
